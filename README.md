# Bandcamp-Tracker Project

The music industry is a dynamic landscape, often challenging to navigate due to its complexity. Recognising trending genres and artists before they hit mainstream popularity is crucial for music enthusiasts, industry professionals, and data analysts. This project aims to address this challenge by providing a service that tracks music purchases over time, offering valuable insights into genre trends and emerging artists.

This project is a data-driven solution that regularly scrapes the latest sales from BandCamp and combines it with genre and artist information. This data is then stored in a cloud-based database. The collected data serves as a foundation for dashboards and reports, offering a comprehensive view of the music industry's trends over time.
